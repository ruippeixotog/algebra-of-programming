## Chapter 3: Applications

This chapter continues the material of [Chapter 2](../02-functions-and-categories/README.md) with one or two simple applications to program derivation, as well as a discussion of additional categorical ideas. It illustrates some of the abstract machinery set up in the preceding chapter with a number of programming techniques and examples. It also discusses some features of functional programming that have not been covered so far in a categorical setting, such as currying and conditionals.
