## Chapter 2: Functions and Categories

This chapter presents the ideas of [Chapter 1](../01-programs/README.md) in categorical terms. It provides a brief introduction to the elements of category theory that are necessary for understanding the rest of the book. Subsequently, it shows how category theory can be used in defining the basic building blocks of datatypes and how these definitions give rise to a set of combinators that unify the operators found in functional programming and program derivation.
